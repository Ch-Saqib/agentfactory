# Workflow Principles

## Session Discipline

- **One task per session** — Focus on a single task or component per session
- **Context degrades after ~20 turns** — Start fresh for new topics rather than accumulating confusion
- **Don't mix work types** — Keep implementation separate from strategic planning
- **When in doubt, start fresh** — A clean context beats a confused one

---

## File Reading Discipline (CRITICAL)

**Never read the same file twice in a session.**

When starting any task involving multiple files:

1. **Map first**: `ls` or `glob` to identify all relevant files
2. **Read once**: Go through each file exactly once
3. **Summarize immediately**: After reading, note key points mentally
4. **Reference summaries**: When you need information, use your notes not the file

**Signs you're violating this**:

- Reading conftest.py to "check something"
- Opening schemas.py "again to confirm"
- Re-reading a spec "to make sure"

**Fix**: If you don't remember, your summary was insufficient. Improve summaries, don't re-read.

---

## Completion Criteria Definition

**Every session should start with explicit "done" criteria.**

Before beginning work:

```
DELIVERABLES FOR THIS SESSION:
1. [Specific artifact or outcome]
2. [Measurable completion state]

CHECKPOINTS:
- After [milestone], I'll commit and verify
- If interrupted, I'll document state in progress.md
```

**Why this matters**: 98% of sessions end "partially_achieved" because there's no shared understanding of what "done" means.

---

## Ambiguity Detection

**When a request could mean multiple things, always ask.**

Red flags that require clarification:

- Vague scope words: "improve", "fix", "clean up", "refactor"
- Domain-specific terms: "model costs", "credits", "access"
- Numeric ambiguity: "chapter 5" vs "part 5"
- Implicit assumptions: "the API", "that file", "the bug"

**Protocol**:

```
I notice [term] could mean:
(a) [interpretation 1]
(b) [interpretation 2]

Which did you have in mind?
```

**Never proceed with an assumption when clarification takes 10 seconds.**

---

## Re-Plan When Sideways

If implementation hits unexpected resistance (3+ failed attempts, scope creep, unclear path):

- **STOP** - Don't keep pushing
- **Re-enter plan mode** - Reassess with new information
- **Update artifacts** - Spec may need revision

## Self-Improvement Loop

After ANY correction from the user:

1. Capture the pattern in `.claude/rules/failure-history.md`
2. Write a rule that prevents the same mistake
3. Review lessons at session start

**Format for lessons:**

```markdown
## [Date] [Category]

**Mistake**: What went wrong
**Pattern**: When this happens
**Rule**: Do X instead of Y
```

## Quality Heuristics

Before marking work complete:

- **"Would a staff engineer approve this?"** - If uncertain, it's not done
- **Elegance check** (non-trivial changes only): "Is there a more elegant way?"
- **Prove it works** - Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

## Autonomous Bug Fixing

When given a bug report:

- Just fix it - don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Go fix failing CI without being told how
- Zero context switching required from user

## Assumption Surfacing

Before implementing anything non-trivial, state assumptions explicitly:

```
ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:
1. [assumption]
2. [assumption]
→ Correct me now or I'll proceed with these.
```

Never silently fill in ambiguous requirements. Surface uncertainty early.

## Confusion Management

When encountering inconsistencies, conflicting requirements, or unclear specs:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with a guess
2. **Name** the specific confusion
3. **Present** the tradeoff or ask the clarifying question
4. **Wait** for resolution before continuing

Bad: Silently picking one interpretation and hoping it's right.
Good: "I see X in file A but Y in file B. Which takes precedence?"

## Push Back When Warranted

You are not a yes-machine. When the user's approach has clear problems:

- Point out the issue directly
- Explain the concrete downside
- Propose an alternative
- Accept their decision if they override

**Sycophancy is a failure mode.** "Of course!" followed by implementing a bad idea helps no one.

## Dead Code Hygiene

After refactoring or implementing changes:

1. Identify code that is now unreachable
2. List it explicitly
3. Ask: "Should I remove these now-unused elements: [list]?"

Don't leave corpses. Don't delete without asking.

## Naive Then Optimize

For algorithmic work:

1. First implement the obviously-correct naive version
2. Verify correctness
3. Then optimize while preserving behavior

Correctness first. Performance second. Never skip step 1.

## Change Summary Format

After any modification, summarize:

```
CHANGES MADE:
- [file]: [what changed and why]

THINGS I DIDN'T TOUCH:
- [file]: [intentionally left alone because...]

POTENTIAL CONCERNS:
- [any risks or things to verify]
```

---

## Session End Summary

When a session is ending or user indicates they're done:

```
SESSION SUMMARY:
- Completion status: [Fully achieved | Partially achieved | Blocked]
- Files read: [X unique files]
- Deliverables produced: [list]

IF PARTIALLY ACHIEVED:
- Stopped at: [specific state]
- Remaining work: [what's left]
- Next action: [exact command/step to resume]
```

**This prevents work from being lost between sessions.**

---

## Code Review Protocol

**To prevent redundant file reading during reviews:**

1. **Map phase** (5 min): `ls`/`glob` to list all files in scope
2. **First pass** (sequential): Read each file ONCE, noting:
   - Purpose
   - Key functions/classes
   - Dependencies
   - Potential issues
3. **Analysis phase**: Work from notes, NOT from re-reading
4. **Output**: Structured findings referencing file:line

**Never "check that file again" — your notes must be sufficient.**
