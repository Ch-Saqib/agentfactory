# CLAUDE.md Context Files

Imagine this: You've been working with Claude Code on your Python project for weeks. Claude has learned your naming conventions, understood your project structure, and adapted to your coding style. You close the terminal for the evening.

The next morning, you open a new Claude Code session and type a question about your project. Claude responds with generic advice—treating your project like it's starting fresh. You have to re-explain your tech stack, your directory structure, your team's conventions.

**This is context friction.** And it's a productivity killer.

Every session starts with zero context. You either repeat explanations repeatedly, or Claude gives generic answers that don't match your project's reality.

**There's a better way.**

---

## What Is CLAUDE.md?

**CLAUDE.md is a simple markdown file placed in your project root that Claude Code automatically loads at the start of every session.** It contains the persistent context your AI companion needs—without you repeating it.

Think of it as a **persistent project brief** that travels with your code:

- Your project does X, Y, and Z
- You use Python 3.13 with FastAPI and PostgreSQL
- Files go in `src/`, tests in `tests/`, database migrations in `alembic/`
- You prefer type hints, Google-style docstrings, and error handling with custom exceptions
- Key commands to run: `uvicorn main:app --reload`, `pytest`, `alembic upgrade head`

When Claude Code starts a new session, it reads CLAUDE.md automatically. Claude **immediately understands your project** without you saying a word.

![Four-layer context architecture showing Working Directory (base), CLAUDE.md (project knowledge), Message History (conversation state), and Current Tools (active capabilities), with information flow arrows](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-1/chapter-03/context-claude.png)

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Why is having persistent context in CLAUDE.md more efficient than repeating project details in every session?"

## How Claude Code Works Behind the Scenes

When you type a message in Claude Code, here's what happens:

```
You → Claude Code (the CLI tool) → AI Model (the LLM) → Response back to you
```

Claude Code is the interface you interact with. It calls an AI model (in this case, Claude) behind the scenes. This distinction matters because of one surprising fact:

**The AI model has no memory between calls.**

Close your terminal. Open a new Claude Code session tomorrow. Ask Claude about your project. Claude won't remember anything—not your tech stack, not your file structure, not even that you talked yesterday. Every new session starts completely blank.

This is called being **"stateless."** Large Language Models (LLMs)—like those powering ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google)—don't store any state (memory, history, context) between requests. Each call is processed in complete isolation.

**"But my conversation seems continuous?"**

That's Claude Code doing extra work. Here's what actually happens:

1. You send message #1 → Claude Code sends it to Claude
2. You send message #2 → Claude Code secretly bundles message #1 + #2 and sends _both_
3. You send message #3 → Claude Code bundles #1 + #2 + #3 and sends _all three_

The LLM reads the whole bundle fresh each time. It _looks_ like a continuous conversation because Claude Code re-sends the history with every message. But the LLM itself is still stateless—it's just being shown the full history repeatedly.

Web apps like ChatGPT and Claude.ai use the same trick.

**Why this matters for coding work:**

For quick questions, re-sending chat history works fine. But for ongoing project work:

| Approach                  | Good For                | Problem                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Re-send chat history      | Short conversations     | Gets too long eventually         |
| Explain project each time | Simple projects         | Exhausting with complex projects |
| Start fresh each time     | Quick one-off questions | Loses project understanding      |

**Claude Code solves this differently.** Instead of trying to keep everything in the conversation history, it treats your **file system as external memory**.

**The insight**: Your code files already contain your project's state. Instead of describing your project to Claude, Claude reads your project directly.

This is why file system access unlocks the "agentic" capability you saw in Lesson 01:

- **Stateless LLM** + **File System Access** = Persistent state through your actual files
- **CLAUDE.md** = The orientation guide Claude reads first in every session
- **Every session**: Claude reads CLAUDE.md, understands your project, and gets to work

The LLM is still stateless. But your files persist. CLAUDE.md ensures Claude's first action in any session is reading the context it needs.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain the difference between how ChatGPT maintains conversation memory versus how Claude Code uses file system access for context persistence. What are the trade-offs of each approach?"

## How CLAUDE.md Auto-Loads

You don't need to do anything. When you start `claude` in a directory, **Claude Code automatically detects and reads the CLAUDE.md file**, loading it into context immediately.

One-time setup. Automatic benefit forever.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain how Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md automatically at session start. What's the mechanism that makes this work without manual commands?"

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> In AI-driven development, context is gold. CLAUDE.md is the cheapest way to give Claude continuous project awareness. Write it once; benefit every session. This is specification-first thinking applied to AI companionship.

---

## What Goes Into CLAUDE.md

CLAUDE.md typically contains 6 sections. Use this structure as your template:

1. Project Overview: What does your project do? What problem does it solve?
2. Technology Stack: Languages, frameworks, databases, key dependencies.
3. Directory Structure: Show the layout so Claude understands where code lives.
4. Coding Conventions: Style, naming, patterns your team follows.
5. Key Commands: Common commands to run the project.
6. Important Notes: Gotchas, dependencies, security considerations.

---

## How to Create Your CLAUDE.md

You could type this all manually. Or—and this is the Claude Code way—**ask Claude to generate it for you.**

Here's the process:

### Step 1: Ask Claude Code to Generate CLAUDE.md

Start Claude Code in your project directory and ask:

```
claude "Help me create a CLAUDE.md file for this project.
What are the main sections I should include, and can you generate a template
based on what you see in the codebase?"
```

Claude will analyze your actual files and propose a CLAUDE.md structure based on your real project.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Create a CLAUDE.md for my [Python/Node/Go/etc] [project type] project. Include: Project Overview (2 sentences), Technology Stack (list), Directory Structure (tree), Coding Conventions (list), Key Commands (list), Important Notes (gotchas). Make it specific to what you see in the codebase."
>
> **Expected Outcome**: Claude generates a CLAUDE.md with all sections populated based on your actual project structure.

### Step 2: Review and Refine

Claude's output is a starting point. Read it carefully. Does it match your project? Are conventions accurate? If Claude guessed wrong or missed details, refine it.

### Step 3: Save the File

Save Claude's output as `CLAUDE.md` in your project root (same directory as `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)

### Step 4: Verify Auto-Loading

Exit Claude Code (`exit` or close terminal). Open a new terminal session in the same directory:

```bash
claude
```

In the new session, ask Claude a question about your project:

```
"What's the tech stack for this project?"
```

**If Claude mentions your stack without you repeating it—CLAUDE.md loaded successfully.**

---

## Why This Matters: Context as Productivity

Here's what you've accomplished:

- ✅ **One-time creation**: 10-15 minutes to write CLAUDE.md
- ✅ **Automatic benefit**: Every session starts with full context
- ✅ **No friction**: No re-explaining project structure, conventions, or setup
- ✅ **Team alignment**: New team members read CLAUDE.md to understand the project

This is the principle of **"specify once, benefit always"**—define your project context one time, and every future session starts with full understanding.

In later lessons, you'll see how subagents (Lesson 11) and skills (Lesson 09) inherit and extend this CLAUDE.md context—making it the foundation for all Claude Code intelligence.

---

## Continue Practicing: Context-Powered Problem Solving

You now have a powerful advantage: CLAUDE.md gives Claude persistent context. Let's see the difference it makes.

### Create a CLAUDE.md for Your Exercises

Open the `basics-exercises` folder from your exercise download (see Lesson 06 for download instructions). Open your terminal there and start Claude:

```bash
claude
```

Ask Claude to create a CLAUDE.md:

```
Create a CLAUDE.md for this exercises folder. I'm a beginner
practicing problem-solving with AI. I prefer clear explanations
and step-by-step verification of results. Look at the modules
and describe what this project is about.
```

Claude will read the folder, see all the modules, and create a CLAUDE.md tailored to your exercises. Approve the file when Claude proposes it.

Now **exit Claude** (type `exit` or press `Ctrl+C`) and **start Claude again**. Ask: `"What do you know about this project?"` — Claude already knows, because it loaded your CLAUDE.md automatically. That's persistent context in action.

### Modules 5-8

These modules are more complex than Modules 1-4. They involve multi-step tasks where having context makes a real difference.

| Module                | What You'll Practice                      | Why CLAUDE.md Helps                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 5. Process Automation | Reusable specs, batch operations          | Claude remembers your naming conventions      |
| 6. Problem Solving    | Multi-turn planning, constraint changes   | Claude maintains project context across turns |
| 7. Quality Control    | Verify output, stress-test specifications | Claude knows your quality standards           |
| 8. Capstone Projects  | End-to-end real projects                  | Full context = better results                 |

Same pattern as before: open the exercise folder in your terminal, run `claude`, tell Claude `"Read INSTRUCTIONS.md and do what it says"`, review, iterate.

:::note Prerequisites
These modules build on Modules 1-4. If you haven't completed at least Module 1 and Module 3 from Lesson 04, go back and do those first.

## Co-Learning: Improving CLAUDE.md Together

Let's see the **Three Roles Framework** in action—where you and Claude Code learn from each other to create a better CLAUDE.md.

### Stage 1: Your First Draft

You create an initial CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
# Project Overview

A Python web app

# Tech Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
```

It's basic, but it's a start.

### Stage 2: AI as Teacher (Claude Teaches You)

Ask Claude to review:

```
"Review my CLAUDE.md. What important sections am I missing?"
```

**Claude responds:**

> "I notice your CLAUDE.md is missing several critical sections:
>
> 1. **Directory Structure** - Where are your route files, models, tests?
> 2. **Coding Conventions** - What style guide? Type hints required?
> 3. **Key Commands** - How do I run the app? Run tests?
> 4. **Database Info** - What database? Migration strategy?
> 5. **API Documentation** - Where's the OpenAPI spec?
>
> For a FastAPI project, these sections help me give better suggestions about imports, file locations, and best practices."

**What just happened?** 🎓 **AI taught you** CLAUDE.md best practices you didn't know. You learned what makes context useful.

### Stage 3: AI as Student (You Teach Claude)

Now you provide domain-specific knowledge Claude doesn't have:

```
"Good points, but our team uses a custom auth pattern. Update CLAUDE.md to reflect:
- All auth goes through middleware/auth.py
- We use custom decorators: @require_auth, @require_admin
- No third-party auth libraries (company policy)
- JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies"
```

**Claude responds:**

> "Got it. I'm updating the Coding Conventions section to reflect your team's auth architecture. This helps me:
>
> - Suggest the correct decorator imports
> - Avoid recommending third-party auth libraries
> - Understand your security model when reviewing code
>
> Here's the updated CLAUDE.md..."

**What just happened?** 🎓 **You taught AI** your team's constraints and patterns. Claude now understands context that doesn't exist in its training data.

### Stage 4: AI as Co-Worker (Converging Together)

You and Claude iterate to refine:

```
"This is better, but the directory structure doesn't show where database migrations live.
How should we organize database-related files?"
```

**Claude responds:**

> "Two common patterns:
>
> 1. **Separated**: `alembic/` at root for migrations + `app/models/` for schemas
> 2. **Grouped**: `database/` folder containing both migrations and models
>
> Which matches your team's style? Or is there a third pattern you prefer?"

**You respond:**

```
"Option 1—we separate concerns. Migrations are infrastructure, models are app code. Update it."
```

**What just happened?** 🎓 **Neither of you** had the complete picture at start. Through conversation, you **converged** on the right solution—Claude offered options, you selected based on team context.

### The Result: Context Created Through Co-Learning

Your final CLAUDE.md is now:

```
# Project Overview
A Python FastAPI web application for internal business workflows

# Tech Stack
- Python 3.13
- FastAPI 0.104
- PostgreSQL 15
- SQLAlchemy 2.0

# Directory Structure

app/
├── models/          # SQLAlchemy models
├── routes/          # API endpoints
├── middleware/      # Custom middleware (auth)
└── tests/           # Pytest test files
alembic/             # Database migrations

# Coding Conventions
- Type hints required on all functions
- Google-style docstrings
- Custom auth: @require_auth, @require_admin decorators
- All auth logic in middleware/auth.py
- NO third-party auth libraries (company policy)
- JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies

# Key Commands
- Run app: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Run tests: `pytest`
- Run migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
- Create migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`

# Important Notes
- Database migrations MUST be reviewed before merge
- All endpoints require authentication except /health
```

**This CLAUDE.md is better** because:

- ✅ Claude taught you what sections to include
- ✅ You taught Claude your team's specific patterns
- ✅ You converged together on the right organization

**This is the Three Roles Framework**—AI collaboration that makes both you and Claude smarter.

---

## Edge Cases and Troubleshooting

### CLAUDE.md Not Loading?

**Symptom**: You created CLAUDE.md, but Claude Code doesn't reference it in new sessions.

**Checklist**:

- ✅ File is named exactly `CLAUDE.md` (case-sensitive)
- ✅ File is in project root (same level as `.git`, `package.json`, etc.)
- ✅ You restarted Claude Code session (new terminal, not same session)
- ✅ File has content (not empty)

**Solution**: If all above are true, restart your terminal completely. Sometimes the session needs a fresh start.

### Unclear What Goes in CLAUDE.md?

**Simple rule**: Ask yourself: _"Does Claude need to know this to give good suggestions?"_ If Claude would ask "What's your tech stack?" without CLAUDE.md, then that information belongs in CLAUDE.md.

### Concerns About File Size?

A typical CLAUDE.md is 1-3 KB. Context is cheap; clarity is expensive. A well-organized CLAUDE.md saves repeated explanations every session and improves Claude's suggestions.

---

## The Universal Standard: AGENTS.md

You've learned how CLAUDE.md provides project context for Claude Code. But what about other AI coding agents—Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and dozens more?

**Enter AGENTS.md**—a universal standard that works across ALL AI coding tools.

### What is AGENTS.md?

AGENTS.md is a simple markdown file (similar to CLAUDE.md) that provides project-specific guidance to **any** AI coding agent. Created by OpenAI and now adopted by 60,000+ open source projects, it's become the industry standard for agent instructions.

**Key difference**:

- **CLAUDE.md** → Claude Code specific (rich features, detailed context)
- **AGENTS.md** → Universal standard (works everywhere)

### Why This Matters: The Agentic AI Foundation

On December 9, 2025, something significant happened. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Block donated their open standards to the Linux Foundation, creating the **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)**:

| Project       | Donated By | Purpose                                   |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **MCP**       | Anthropic  | Protocol for connecting AI to tools/data  |
| **AGENTS.md** | OpenAI     | Universal project instructions for agents |
| **Goose**     | Block      | Open-source agent framework               |

This means AGENTS.md is now a **neutral, vendor-independent standard**—like how Kubernetes standardized containers or how HTTP standardized the web.

### The Best of Both Worlds

Here's the practical approach: **use both**.

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md      # Rich context for Claude Code (your primary tool)
├── AGENTS.md      # Universal context for any AI agent
├── src/
└── ...
```

**In your CLAUDE.md**, simply reference AGENTS.md:

```markdown
# Project Context

See @AGENTS.md for universal project guidelines that apply to all AI agents.

## Claude-Specific Instructions

[Additional Claude Code specific context, skills, hooks, etc.]
```

This approach gives you:

- ✅ **Portability**: Any AI agent understands your project via AGENTS.md
- ✅ **Depth**: Claude Code gets rich context via CLAUDE.md
- ✅ **No duplication**: Common info in AGENTS.md, Claude-specific in CLAUDE.md

### What Goes in AGENTS.md vs CLAUDE.md?

| Content                | AGENTS.md | CLAUDE.md            |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Project overview       | ✅        | Reference @AGENTS.md |
| Tech stack             | ✅        | Reference @AGENTS.md |
| Directory structure    | ✅        | Reference @AGENTS.md |
| Coding conventions     | ✅        | Reference @AGENTS.md |
| Key commands           | ✅        | Reference @AGENTS.md |
| Claude-specific skills | ❌        | ✅                   |
| MCP server configs     | ❌        | ✅                   |
| Subagent definitions   | ❌        | ✅                   |
| Hooks configuration    | ❌        | ✅                   |

**Simple rule**: Universal project context → AGENTS.md. Claude Code features → CLAUDE.md.

### Creating Your AGENTS.md

Ask Claude Code to generate both files:

```
"Create an AGENTS.md file with universal project context that any AI coding agent
can understand. Then update my CLAUDE.md to reference @AGENTS.md for common context
and add Claude-specific instructions separately."
```

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> The AAIF announcement signals a maturing industry. Instead of every AI tool having its own context format, we're converging on standards. This is good for developers—write your project context once in AGENTS.md, and it works everywhere. Add Claude-specific power features in CLAUDE.md. One universal standard + one specialized configuration = maximum productivity.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain why having a universal standard like AGENTS.md benefits the AI development ecosystem. How does this compare to other standardization efforts like HTTP, Kubernetes, or USB?"

## Try With AI

Let's create a CLAUDE.md file that eliminates context friction and makes every session productive from the start.

**🔍 Explore Auto-Generation:**

> "Help me create a complete CLAUDE.md file for this project. Analyze what you can see in the codebase and generate a file with these sections: Project Overview (1-2 sentences), Technology Stack (bulleted list), Directory Structure (tree diagram), Coding Conventions (bulleted list), Key Commands (for running, testing, deploying), and Important Notes (gotchas or critical context). Base everything on the actual files you can read."

**What you're learning:** How Claude Code uses filesystem access to generate context it couldn't create from conversation alone. The AI reads your actual code to propose accurate context.

**🎯 Practice Collaborative Refinement:**

> "Review the CLAUDE.md you just created. I need to add my team's specific constraints: [describe your specific conventions, patterns, or requirements]. Update the file to reflect these details, and ask me clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous."

**What you're learning:** The Three Roles pattern in action—you teach Claude your domain knowledge (constraints, conventions) while Claude teaches you what good CLAUDE.md structure looks like.

**🧪 Test Context Persistence:**

> "I'm going to test if CLAUDE.md auto-loads correctly. First, tell me what tech stack this project uses based on the CLAUDE.md. Then I'll exit and start a new session to verify you remember it without me repeating anything."

**What you're learning:** Verifying that persistent context actually works. This builds trust in the mechanism before you rely on it for real work.

**🚀 Optimize for Your Workflow:**

> "Now that CLAUDE.md is working, help me identify what ELSE should go in it based on my workflow: I frequently [describe your common tasks: write tests, add API endpoints, update documentation, etc.]. What context would help you give better suggestions for these tasks?"

**What you're learning:** How to evolve CLAUDE.md from "good enough" to "optimized for you." Context that helps Claude help you is always worth discovering.
