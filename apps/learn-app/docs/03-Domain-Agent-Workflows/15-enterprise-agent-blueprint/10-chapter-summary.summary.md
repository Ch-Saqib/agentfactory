### Core Concept

Chapter 15 provides the complete architecture for a Cowork plugin: the plugin package structure (SKILL.md, connectors, commands, agents, manifest), three owners (knowledge worker, IT, administrator), three context levels (platform, organisation, plugin), four governance mechanisms (permissions, audit trails, shadow mode, HITL gates), and a marketplace distribution model. The nine lessons form a chain — each lesson answered a question the previous one raised. The SKILL.md is the component that everything else serves, and writing a production-quality one requires Chapter 16's Knowledge Extraction Method.

### Key Mental Models

- **Architecture as Chain**: Each lesson's answer generated the next question — definition → intelligence layer → deployment environment → context hierarchy → production example → connector ecosystem → governance → ownership → marketplace
- **SKILL.md Primacy**: The infrastructure components (connectors, commands, manifest) serve the SKILL.md — they provide the environment and data that the intelligence layer uses. Remove the SKILL.md and you have deployment infrastructure without intelligence.
- **Knowledge Worker's Authorial Role**: Writing SKILL.md requires domain expertise, not programming. Reviewing .mcp.json for verification requires infrastructure literacy, not systems engineering. Designing shadow mode rubrics requires domain knowledge of accuracy, not statistical training.
- **Governance as Trust Architecture**: Shadow mode, audit trails, and HITL gates produce the evidence that converts a promising demonstration into a deployable system — governance is the beginning of the trust story, not the end of the deployment story.

### Critical Patterns

- The plugin package components are not parallel — they have a hierarchy: SKILL.md is intelligence, manifest and settings define deployment environment, connectors are data infrastructure
- A domain expert can deploy a production-grade agent without writing code — the SKILL.md is plain English, the other components are owned by IT and administrators
- Chapter 16 addresses the one gap the chapter deliberately left open: how to extract and encode tacit domain expertise into the SKILL.md (the Knowledge Extraction Method)
- Self-assessment checklist: plugin package structure, PQP Framework, source integrity/uncertainty calibration, three-level context hierarchy, shadow mode criteria, ownership model (given a failure, can you assign it without deliberating?), and the marketplace transferability test

### Common Mistakes

- Believing architectural understanding means knowing how to write a production SKILL.md — this chapter taught the architecture; Chapter 16 teaches the extraction methodology
- Underestimating the SKILL.md's criticality — it determines whether the plugin is trustworthy, not merely functional
- Treating the ownership model as organisational formality rather than the mechanism that makes failures diagnosable and prevents slow degradation

### Connections

- **Builds on**: All nine lessons of Chapter 15, synthesised into a coherent deployment architecture
- **Leads to**: Chapter 16 — The Knowledge Extraction Method — which addresses how to make tacit domain expertise explicit and encode it into the Persona, Questions, and Principles of a production-quality SKILL.md
