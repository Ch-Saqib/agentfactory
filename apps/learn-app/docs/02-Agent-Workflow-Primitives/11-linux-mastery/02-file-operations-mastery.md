    - "Spend extra time on wildcards — students breeze through file creation/copying but stumble on pattern matching, which is critical for lesson 6 (text processing)"

# File Operations Mastery

You're deploying a new version of your AI agent at 11 PM on a Thursday. The routing rules are updated, the environment variables are mapped across three environments -- staging, canary, production. Four hours of careful configuration work. You've done this deployment cleanup a hundred times, so you type the command from muscle memory: `rm -rf` followed by the path to the old deployment directory. You press Enter. No confirmation prompt. No progress bar. Just your terminal, sitting there, cursor blinking, waiting for the next command.

You run `ls` to verify the cleanup. The directory you meant to delete is still there. The directory you didn't mean to delete -- the one containing four hours of configuration work, the custom routing rules, the environment variable mappings, the entire configuration tree for three environments -- is empty. Not the files inside it. The directory itself, gutted. Gone. No recycle bin on Linux. No undo. No "Are you sure?" that you accidentally dismissed. Just silence, and then the slow realization of what happened.

The cost was concrete: four hours rebuilding every configuration file from memory and scattered Slack messages. A release that should have shipped at midnight slipped to 4 AM. Three customers hit the old routing rules during the gap. Your team lead's message at 12:30 AM -- "What's the status?" -- still sits in your inbox.

The fix that would have prevented all of it was three flags and one habit. `rm -i` prompts you before every deletion -- "remove this file?" -- so you see exactly what's about to disappear. `rm -v` prints each file as it's deleted, so silence never means mystery. And the habit: run `ls` on your target before any destructive command, every single time, even when you've done it a hundred times before. Especially when you've done it a hundred times before, because that's when muscle memory types the wrong path.

This lesson makes file operations deliberate -- so you never have a silent `rm -rf` story of your own.

:::tip[The principle]
Linux has no undo button. The skill is knowing exactly what you're about to delete before you delete it.

## Creating Files and Directories

Every workspace starts empty. Let's build one from scratch.

### Creating Empty Files with touch

The `touch` command creates an empty file. If the file already exists, it updates its timestamp without changing content.

```bash
cd ~
touch my-first-file.txt
ls -l my-first-file.txt
```

**Output:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 0 Feb  9 14:30 my-first-file.txt
```

Notice the file size is `0` -- `touch` creates the file but puts nothing in it. This is useful for creating placeholder files, empty logs, or files you'll populate later.

You can create multiple files at once:

```bash
touch agent.log config.yaml README.md
ls -l agent.log config.yaml README.md
```

**Output:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 0 Feb  9 14:31 agent.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 0 Feb  9 14:31 config.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 yourname yourname 0 Feb  9 14:31 README.md
```

### Creating Directories with mkdir

Use `mkdir` to create directories:

```bash
mkdir my-agent
ls -d my-agent
```

**Output:**
```
my-agent
```

But what if you need a nested structure? This fails:

```bash
mkdir my-agent/src/handlers
```

**Output:**
```
mkdir: cannot create directory 'my-agent/src/handlers': No such file or directory
```

The parent directory `my-agent/src` doesn't exist yet. The `-p` flag solves this by creating all parent directories as needed:

```bash
mkdir -p my-agent/src/handlers
ls -R my-agent
```

**Output:**
```
my-agent:
src

my-agent/src:
handlers

my-agent/src/handlers:
```

The `-p` flag is your go-to for building workspace structures. It never fails because missing parents exist, and it doesn't complain if directories already exist.

### Building a Complete Agent Workspace

Let's build a realistic workspace structure using brace expansion — a shell shortcut that automatically expands `{src,config,logs,data}` into four separate names, saving you from typing each one individually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/agents/customer-bot/{src,config,logs,data}
ls -R ~/agents/customer-bot
```

**Output:**
```
/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot:
config  data  logs  src

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/config:

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/data:

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/logs:

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/src:
```

One command created a complete agent workspace with four organized subdirectories. This is the kind of structure your deployed agents will use: source code in `src`, settings in `config`, runtime output in `logs`, and persistent storage in `data`.

---

## Copying Files and Directories

Once files exist, you often need duplicates -- backups, templates, or copies for different environments.

### Copying a Single File

```bash
cd ~/agents/customer-bot
touch config/settings.yaml
cp config/settings.yaml config/settings.yaml.backup
ls config/
```

**Output:**
```
settings.yaml  settings.yaml.backup
```

The `cp` command takes two arguments: source and destination. If the destination is a filename, it creates a copy with that name. If the destination is a directory, it copies the file into that directory keeping the original name:

```bash
cp config/settings.yaml data/
ls data/
```

**Output:**
```
settings.yaml
```

### Copying Directories Recursively

To copy an entire directory and its contents, use the `-r` (recursive) flag:

```bash
cp -r config config-staging
ls -R config-staging/
```

**Output:**
```
config-staging/:
settings.yaml  settings.yaml.backup
```

Without `-r`, attempting to copy a directory fails:

```bash
cp config config-test
```

**Output:**
```
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'config'
```

This is a safety mechanism -- copying directories involves potentially thousands of files, so the system requires you to explicitly confirm with `-r`.

---

## Moving and Renaming Files

The `mv` command serves two purposes: moving files to a different location and renaming them. Under the hood, both operations are the same -- changing where a file's name points in the filesystem. Here are all four variations in sequence:

```bash
touch src/main.py                              # → create a file to work with
mv src/main.py src/handlers/                   # → move it into a subdirectory
ls src/handlers/                               # → confirm: main.py

mv src/handlers/main.py src/handlers/agent_main.py  # → rename (same directory)
ls src/handlers/                               # → confirm: agent_main.py

mv src/handlers/agent_main.py src/app.py       # → move AND rename in one step
ls src/                                        # → confirm: app.py  handlers

mv config-staging config-production            # → rename a directory (no flags needed)
ls -d config-production                        # → confirm: config-production
```

**Output:**
```
main.py
agent_main.py
app.py  handlers
config-production
```

The pattern: when source and destination are in the same directory, `mv` renames. When they are in different directories, `mv` moves. You can do both at once. And unlike `cp -r`, directories need no special flags -- `mv` handles them directly.

---

## Deleting Files Safely

Deletion on Linux is permanent. There is no recycle bin, no trash folder, no undo. When a file is deleted, it's gone. This makes safe deletion practices essential.

### Safe Deletion with rm -i

Always start with `rm -i` (interactive mode), which asks for confirmation before each deletion:

```bash
touch temp-file.txt
rm -i temp-file.txt
```

**Output:**
```
rm: remove regular empty file 'temp-file.txt'? y
```

You must type `y` and press Enter to confirm. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes before they become permanent.

### Deleting Multiple Files

```bash
touch old-1.log old-2.log old-3.log
rm -i old-*.log
```

**Output:**
```
rm: remove regular empty file 'old-1.log'? y
rm: remove regular empty file 'old-2.log'? y
rm: remove regular empty file 'old-3.log'? y
```

Each file requires confirmation. For three files, this is manageable. For three hundred, you'll need the recursive approach below -- but only after verifying with `ls` first.

### Deleting Directories with rm -r

To delete a directory and everything inside it:

```bash
rm -ri config-production
```

**Output:**
```
rm: descend into directory 'config-production'? y
rm: remove regular empty file 'config-production/settings.yaml'? y
rm: remove regular empty file 'config-production/settings.yaml.backup'? y
rm: remove directory 'config-production'? y
```

The `-r` flag means recursive (delete contents first, then the directory). Combined with `-i`, you confirm each step.

:::danger rm -rf: The Most Dangerous Command in Linux

The command `rm -rf` removes files and directories recursively (`-r`) without any confirmation (`-f` = force). It executes instantly and cannot be undone.

**Before using rm -rf, ALWAYS verify what will be deleted:**

```bash
# STEP 1: See what will be affected
ls target-directory/

# STEP 2: Only after confirming the contents are correct
rm -rf target-directory/
```

**Commands you must NEVER run:**

- `rm -rf /` -- Deletes every file on the entire system
- `rm -rf ~` -- Deletes your entire home directory and all your work
- `rm -rf *` in the wrong directory -- Deletes everything in the current directory

**The safe pattern**: Use `rm -i` first to see what will be deleted. Once you've confirmed the target is correct, then use `rm -rf` if needed for speed.

:::

:::note[Destructive vs deliberate operations]
| Without file operation mastery | With file operation mastery |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `rm -rf` without confirming location | `pwd` then `ls` then `rm -i` |
| Copy overwrites without warning | `cp -n` (no-clobber) or backup first |
| Lost configs rebuilt from memory | Backup copies before changes |
| Hours of rework | Minutes of caution |
:::

---

## Reading File Contents

Agents produce output: logs, reports, data files. You need to read these files without opening a graphical editor.

### Reading Entire Files with cat

The `cat` command prints an entire file to the terminal:

```bash
cd ~/agents/customer-bot
echo "agent_name: customer-bot" > config/settings.yaml
echo "port: 8080" >> config/settings.yaml
echo "log_level: info" >> config/settings.yaml
cat config/settings.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
agent_name: customer-bot
port: 8080
log_level: info
```

`cat` is ideal for short files (under ~50 lines). For long files, it floods your terminal with text.

### Reading the Beginning with head

The `head` command shows the first lines of a file. By default, it shows 10 lines. Use `-n` to specify how many:

```bash
# Create a longer file for demonstration
for i in $(seq 1 20); do echo "Log entry $i: Agent processed request" >> logs/agent.log; done
head -n 5 logs/agent.log
```

**Output:**
```
Log entry 1: Agent processed request
Log entry 2: Agent processed request
Log entry 3: Agent processed request
Log entry 4: Agent processed request
Log entry 5: Agent processed request
```

### Reading the End with tail

The `tail` command shows the last lines of a file. This is especially useful for log files where the most recent entries are at the bottom:

```bash
tail -n 3 logs/agent.log
```

**Output:**
```
Log entry 18: Agent processed request
Log entry 19: Agent processed request
Log entry 20: Agent processed request
```

When debugging an agent, `tail` is usually your first command -- it shows you what happened most recently.

### Scrolling Through Long Files with less

For files too long for `cat` but where you need to read more than just the beginning or end, use `less`:

```bash
less logs/agent.log
```

`less` opens the file in a scrollable viewer:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Arrow keys** | Scroll up/down line by line |
| **Space** | Scroll down one page |
| **b** | Scroll up one page |
| **/search-term** | Search forward for text |
| **n** | Jump to next search match |
| **q** | Quit and return to terminal |

`less` doesn't load the entire file into memory, so it works on files of any size -- even gigabyte log files from long-running agents.

### When to Use Each Reading Command

| Command | Best For | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `cat` | Short files (under 50 lines) | Config files, small scripts |
| `head -n N` | Checking file format or headers | CSV headers, log format |
| `tail -n N` | Recent log entries, latest errors | Agent debugging |
| `less` | Exploring large files interactively | Full log analysis |

---

## Wildcards and Globbing

File pattern matching — using `*`, `?`, and `[]` to operate on groups of files — is one of the most powerful CLI skills. You'll meet it properly in [Lesson 6](./06-text-processing-automation.md) where it becomes essential for log parsing pipelines. For now, one rule covers most situations: `ls *.log` lists all log files. The `*` matches anything.

---

## Getting Help: man Pages and --help

When you encounter an unfamiliar command or need to check a specific flag, Linux has built-in documentation.

### Quick Help with --help

Most commands support a `--help` flag that prints a usage summary:

```bash
cp --help
```

**Output (abbreviated):**
```
Usage: cp [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

  -r, -R, --recursive    copy directories recursively
  -i, --interactive       prompt before overwrite
  -v, --verbose           explain what is being done
```

This gives you a fast reminder of available options without leaving your terminal.

### Detailed Documentation with man

The `man` command opens the full manual page for any command:

```bash
man cp
```

This opens a detailed reference in `less` (the same viewer you learned earlier). Navigate with the same keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Arrow keys** | Scroll up/down |
| **/pattern** | Search for text |
| **n** | Next search match |
| **q** | Quit man page |

Man pages are organized into sections: NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, and EXAMPLES. When you need to understand a specific flag, search with `/` followed by the flag name (like `/-r`).

:::tip[Minimum Viable Skill]
If you take one thing from this lesson: `cp file file.backup` before editing anything critical. This single habit prevents the most common production data loss — editing a file and discovering ten minutes later that it cannot be restored.
:::

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Build an Agent Workspace

**Task:** Create a complete workspace for an agent called `customer-bot` with subdirectories for source code, configuration, logs, and data.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/agents/customer-bot/{src,config,logs,data}
```

**Verify your work:**

```bash
ls -R ~/agents/customer-bot
```

**Expected output:**
```
/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot:
config  data  logs  src

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/config:

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/data:

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/logs:

/home/yourname/agents/customer-bot/src:
```

You should see four subdirectories: `config`, `data`, `logs`, and `src`.

### Exercise 2: Create, Copy, and Move Files

**Task:** Create a configuration file, copy it as a backup, then move the backup to a different directory.

```bash
cd ~/agents/customer-bot
echo "port: 8080" > config/app.yaml
cp config/app.yaml config/app.yaml.backup
mv config/app.yaml.backup data/
```

**Verify your work:**

```bash
ls config/ data/
```

**Expected output:**
```
config/:
app.yaml  settings.yaml

data/:
app.yaml.backup  settings.yaml
```

The original `app.yaml` stays in `config/`, while `app.yaml.backup` was copied then moved to `data/`.

### Exercise 3: Wildcards in Action

**Task:** Create five numbered log files and use wildcards to list only those files.

```bash
cd ~/agents/customer-bot/logs
touch agent-1.log agent-2.log agent-3.log agent-4.log agent-5.log
```

**Verify your work:**

```bash
ls agent-*.log
```

**Expected output:**
```
agent-1.log  agent-2.log  agent-3.log  agent-4.log  agent-5.log
```

Now use the `?` wildcard to match only single-digit agent logs:

```bash
ls agent-?.log
```

**Expected output:**
```
agent-1.log  agent-2.log  agent-3.log  agent-4.log  agent-5.log
```

All five match because each has exactly one character between `agent-` and `.log`.

---

## Try With AI

**Build SupportBot's Home:**

```
I'm deploying SupportBot — a FastAPI agent — to a production Linux server.
Help me set up its workspace step by step. For each command, show me what
to type and what output to expect:

1. Create the application directory at /opt/support-bot/
2. Create a config directory at /etc/support-bot/
3. Create a logs directory at /var/log/support-bot/
4. Create a placeholder agent_main.py in the application directory
5. Verify all three directories exist with a single ls command

After we create everything, ask me to navigate between the three locations
using both absolute and relative paths to make sure I can find them under
pressure.
```

**What you're learning:** Translating a real deployment requirement into filesystem commands. SupportBot needs exactly this directory structure in Lesson 12 — the file organization you practice here is the same structure you'll use when the deployment is real.

**Understand Copy vs Move:**

```
Explain the difference between cp and mv using a real-world analogy.
Then give me 3 specific scenarios for managing AI agent deployments
where I would use cp, and 3 where I would use mv. For each scenario,
show the exact command I would run.
```

**What you're learning:** Building judgment about when to duplicate files versus relocate them. In agent management, choosing wrong can mean losing your only copy of a configuration file or cluttering your workspace with unnecessary duplicates.

**Recover from Mistakes:**

```
I accidentally deleted an important configuration file with rm.
What are my recovery options on Linux? Also, what practices can
I adopt to prevent accidental deletions when managing agent files?
Give me specific commands and habits I should build.
```

**What you're learning:** Defensive file management practices. Linux doesn't have an undo button, so prevention strategies (aliases, backups, interactive mode defaults) are essential skills for anyone managing production agent deployments.

---

You can now create, copy, move, and delete files -- and more importantly, do it deliberately without losing production data. But managing files is only half the work. The other half is reading them. In the next lesson, you'll discover that `cat` is often the wrong tool for a 2GB log file, and that a single pipe character can turn five separate commands into one powerful operation. The unix philosophy of small tools chained together is about to become your fastest diagnostic weapon.
